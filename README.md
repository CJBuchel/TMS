# Tournament Management System

The Tournament Management System (TMS) is an [open source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) digital alternative designed to streamline scoring and management of teams in [FLL](https://www.firstlegoleague.org/).
Operating on a locally hosted server to score, store and ignore.

Initially focused on robot game scoring, TMS has evolved to support more than just the odd score input and ranking board.
Providing an ongoing list of features. Including:

- Schedule management and live shuffling
- Real-time pit displays of upcoming matches and judging sessions
- Native iOS builds for offline storage
- Managed timers with game sounds
- Dedicated screens for announcers, referees, and officials

With ongoing development, TMS aims to introduce further enhancements, reducing the reliance on paper and streamlining the experience for FLL teams, volunteers and organizers alike.
