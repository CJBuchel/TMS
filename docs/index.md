Initially focused on robot game scoring, TMS has evolved to provide an ongoing list of features. Including:

- Schedule management and live shuffling
- Real-time pit displays of upcoming matches and judging sessions
- Native iOS and Android builds for offline storage/scoring
- Managed timers with game sounds
- Dedicated screens for announcers, referees, and officials

With ongoing development, TMS aims to introduce further enhancements, reducing reliance on paper systems and streamlining the experience for FLL teams, volunteers and organizers alike.
