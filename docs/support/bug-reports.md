# Bug Reports

TMS is maintained by unpaid gremlins, and often when not fed enough coffee, bugs can slip through the cracks. If you think you have discovered a bug, you can help by submitting an issue to our 
issue tracker.

## Before you submit
Before you submit a bug report, please check the following:

- **Search the issue tracker**: Search the issue tracker to see if the bug has already been reported. If it has, please add any additional information you have to the existing report.
- **Check the Q&A**: Check the [Q&A] to see if the issue is a common question or has already been answered.
- **Update to the latest version**: Make sure you are running the latest version of TMS. The bug may have already been fixed.

!!! warning "Bugs are resolved in order of priority"
    Bugs are resolved in order of priority. If the bug you have found is not critical, it may take some time to be resolved. And in rare cases, may be marked as `wontfix`. If time is of the essence, you may want to consider submitting a pull request with a fix.
    

## Submitting a bug report
If you have checked the above and are confident that you have found a bug, please raise an issue.
