# Change Requests

TMS is maintained by unpaid gremlins, if you are unhappy with the work they have done or have a feature request, you can help by submitting a change request to our issue tracker. And we will try our best to implement it by persuading the gremlins with cake.

## Before you submit
Before you submit a change request, please check the following:

- **Search the issue tracker**: Search the issue tracker to see if the change has already been requested. If it has, you can add additional context or information to the existing request.
- **Check the discussions**: Check the [discussions] to see if the change or feature has been talked about before. Maybe there is a reason why it hasn't been implemented?
- **It's not a bug, it's a feature**: Change requests are not for reporting bugs unless it's related to solving a bug. If you have found a bug, please submit a bug report using the issue tracker.

!!! note "Change requests are not guaranteed"
    Change requests are not guaranteed to be implemented. The gremlins have a lot of work to do and may not have time to implement every change request. But they will try their best to implement the most requested features in order or priority.

## Submitting a change request
If you have checked the the above and would still like to submit a change request, please raise a change request.
