# TMS Planning

## Is TMS for me?
If you are a [Tournament Director](https://www.firstaustralia.org/tournament-directors) or likewise planning on [Running an Event](https://www.firstaustralia.org/run-an-event). And you are debating to use TMS, consider the following:

- **Technical Knowledge**: TMS requires a basic understanding of networking and website management. And preferably runs with a dedicated IT admin to setup and run TMS during an event. While TMS aims to provide a simple and effective solution, it is not always plug and play.
- **Hardware & Devices**: TMS is a digital alternative to paper. And therefore requires the usage of plenty of devices to get the same effect.
    - **Server**: A dedicated laptop/desktop or similar to run the software, with constant local network access.
    - **Scoring Devices**: Tablets, laptops, phones, etc. to access the server over the network and input scores. Either through the web, or using the App.
    - **Display Devices**: TVs, projectors, etc. to display the scores and schedules to the audience.
    - **Network Infrastructure**: For the best result, TMS requires a stable network connection. This can be achieved through a dedicated local network and router. Or through the use of the venue internet. Although, some events *have* run on a simple hot-spot.

!!! note "Internet Access"
    Internet access is not required for TMS to run, devices just need to access the server on the local network. Unless you are using a cloud version of TMS or need access for special API requirements.

- **Teams**: TMS is designed for larger events with many teams, where scheduling and scoring can be a challenge, and time management is critical. If you are running a small event, TMS may be overkill for your needs. And in some cases may be more of a hindrance than help.

If you don't have most or all of the previous points, TMS may not be the best fit for your event. And you may want to consider other options. But if you do have access to these items and you are planning for a large event. Then TMS can provide a streamlined and efficient solution to manage your event while still give your tournament a vibrant atmosphere for teams.

## Planning your Event
If you have decided to use TMS for your event, the next step is to plan how you will use it. This includes: the involvement of your IT admin, the setup of your network, the devices you will use and the training of your volunteers.
